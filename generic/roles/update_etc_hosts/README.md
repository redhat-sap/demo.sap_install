Example Playbook
----------------

If you want to setup/add entries your etc hosts you can use this snippet

```[yaml]
- name: Ensure /etc/hosts is updated 
  include_role: sap_update_etc_hosts
  var:
        update_etc_hosts_list:
                - node_ip: 1.2.3.4
                  node_name: host1
                  aliases:
                    - alias1
                    - anotheralias2
                  comment: "Here comes text after hashsign" (defaults to hana_site)
                  state: present
                - node_ip: 1.2.3.5
                  node_name: host2
                  state: absent
```
If you have defined a cluster and the variable `sap_ha_pacemaker_cluster_cluster_nodes` or `sap_hana_cluster_nodes` is set, you can use the follwoing play:

```[yaml]
- name: ensure all cluster nodes are in /etc/hosts
  include_role: update_etc_hosts
  var:
        update_etc_hosts_list: "{{ sap_hana_cluster_nodes }}
```
